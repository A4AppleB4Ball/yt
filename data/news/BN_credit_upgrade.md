## 🏦 / 💸 Which Finance / NBFCs got upgraded

The three finance companies / non-bank finance firms upgraded are: ([ETBFSI.com][3])

* Bajaj Finance
* Tata Capital
* L&T Finance

Alongside the issuer credit rating upgrade, S&P also revised upward the *stand-alone credit profiles* (SACP) for several of these entities. ([The Financial Express][5])

## 📈 What S&P said — underlying rationale & expectations

* S&P expects these banks and finance firms to maintain **adequate asset quality**, **good profitability**, and **enhanced capitalisation** over the next 12–24 months. ([ETBFSI.com][3])
* The agency highlighted structural improvements — especially in loan-recovery and credit culture — to strengthen resilience of financial institutions. For example, it pointed to the effect of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) in improving recovery and discipline. ([ETBFSI.com][3])
* Despite some “pockets of stress”, S&P believes overall systemic risk has reduced and credit risk across the banking/financial sector has moderated. ([The Economic Times][1])
* The upgrade also reflects the broader macroeconomic optimism — following S&P’s upgrade of India’s sovereign rating — based on India’s economic fundamentals, improved fiscal-monetary policy framework, and growth prospects. ([Reuters][6])

---

## 🔎 Broader context & implications

* Because many financial-institution ratings are “capped by” sovereign rating, the sovereign upgrade helped unlock upward revisions for banks/NBFCs. ([ETBFSI.com][3])
* The rating upgrade improves borrowing cost prospects for these institutions (especially those with overseas borrowings), likely lowering interest costs for funding. ([finmen.in][7])
* For investors and markets: improved credit ratings enhance confidence in Indian banks and NBFCs, making them more attractive for debt financing, foreign investment, and raising capital. This could strengthen the overall financial sector. ([ETBFSI.com][3])
* It suggests policymakers and regulators may continue focusing on reforms to maintain stability — especially in asset-quality, resolution of bad loans, and enabling credit growth in a stable macroeconomic environment.
