Key provisions of the law: stablecoin issuers must maintain 1:1 backing with “liquid assets” (U.S. dollars or short-term Treasuries), provide monthly public disclosures of reserve composition, follow strict marketing and transparency rules, and comply with anti-money laundering, customer-protection and accountability frameworks.

The act also delineates regulatory jurisdiction: payment-stablecoins issued by compliant issuers will not be treated as securities or commodities — effectively creating a regulated but separate “stablecoin financial infrastructure.”
