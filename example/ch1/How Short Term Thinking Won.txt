00:00 If you ever feel like the world has become 
incredibly focused on short-term results, that's  
00:04 probably not your imagination. People are living 
paycheck to paycheck. Companies are being managed  
00:09 earnings report to earnings report. Financial 
markets are waiting for the next interest rate  
00:13 movement. Political decisions are being made for 
the next election cycle. Entire industries have  
00:17 been created just to be sold to the next biggest 
investor. And all of this is being held together  
00:22 by loans that are being written to last just long 
enough to be bundled up into fixed income assets.  
00:27 This month, people were losing their minds because 
for the first time since it was introduced,  
00:31 the Bureau of Labor Statistics did not publish 
its monthly jobs report because the household  
00:36 survey data could not be collected during the 
government shutdown. Now, this may be a sign  
00:40 of bigger issues under the surface, but the most 
immediate problem right now is that the Fed can't  
00:45 set interest rates without completely up-to-date 
information. These decisions should be made on  
00:50 long-term strategic plans, not noisy, and let's 
be honest, questionable month-to-month data.  
00:56 But a few things have changed which for a lot of 
markets means that bad news is good news. A lot of  
01:01 people are actually hoping for more unemployment 
because job losses force the Fed to lower interest  
01:06 rates and lower interest rates means cheaper 
borrowing and cheaper borrowing means debt  
01:10 fueled speculation can go on a little longer. 
Now if you think this is all a little bit dumb  
01:15 that's because it is. But at the center of all 
of these issues there is the question of is our  
01:20 entire economy just surviving quarter to quarter? 
KLARNA's buy now pay later interest free loan  
01:25 model may be backfiring. The financial services 
company net loss more than doubled in the first  
01:30 quarter. It's not making any money. In fact, it's 
burning cash. Cisco has officially completed its  
01:34 $28 billion acquisition of Splunk. Record revenue 
in the third quarter. $57 billion. Then eventually  
01:41 we'll find a way to to benefit from that. 
Working a full-time job. It's not enough. I work  
01:45 full-time. He works more than full-time. I don't 
know what to do. Last month, a report by Goldman  
01:52 Sachs found that more people than ever were living 
paycheck to paycheck. Now, I know that by itself,  
01:56 this is a trend that is not that surprising 
anymore, but it goes beyond this. More people  
02:01 than ever weren't even making it that far. Living 
paycheck to paycheck is a luxury compared to the  
02:07 new reality of living wage advanced to credit 
card bill. It's no secret that prices for everyday  
02:12 goods and services have increased by a lot in the 
last 5 years. But prices are a function of supply  
02:17 and demand. And demand itself is a function of 
what people are willing and able to purchase.  
02:22 Prices have only been able to stay this high 
because for now at least people have been able to  
02:27 afford it. But that ability has increasingly come 
from new and creative forms of debt. It's also no  
02:33 secret that the hottest new form of consumer debt 
bridging that gap is buy now pay later services.  
02:37 Now these loans are technically not counted 
as official consumer debt for some reason. So,  
02:43 the exact extent of their lending is hard to 
get precise data on. However, by all estimates,  
02:49 it's still in the hundreds of billions of dollars 
within America alone. Now, I am not bringing this  
02:54 up just to rant about inflation, consumers being 
stretched, or predatory buy now pay later systems.  
02:59 I have done that in plenty of separate videos. 
This industry is just one example of a bigger  
03:04 trend. The point here is that none of these buy 
now pay later companies make any money either.  
03:10 Most of them are still burning billions of 
dollars of investor money every year to gain  
03:13 market share in a market that hasn't actually 
made any money yet. So, we have households who  
03:19 can't afford to pay upfront for basic purchases 
being financed by an industry that can't afford  
03:23 to operate beyond the next quarter without being 
supported by investor dollars. Investor dollars  
03:28 that are primarily coming from venture capital and 
private equity firms who themselves are financed  
03:33 by a complicated network of debt and internal 
dealing, all of which is now showing questionable  
03:37 real returns. Now, bad businesses come and go all 
the time. That's the nature of capitalism. But  
03:43 what is different today more than ever before is 
that everybody involved in this string of failure  
03:48 is still making life-changing amounts of money. 
Founders and early employees are cashing out on  
03:53 their stock. Private equity managers are making 
enormous bonuses. Investors are enjoying returns  
03:57 that look good on paper. And regular people 
get to finance their burrito. Along this chain,  
04:02 nobody is actually making any money. But everybody 
is getting paid. Even if this whole industry  
04:08 implodes tomorrow, most of the insiders could walk 
away having made enough money that they will never  
04:12 need to work again. Taking short-term rewards at 
the expense of long-term objectives is just human  
04:18 nature. Our monkey brains need a lot of discipline 
to stop us from enjoying a little treat right now  
04:23 so that we can be in shape for summer 6 months 
away. In the past, these trade-offs were true  
04:27 in business as well. Long-term diligent saving, 
investing, and operating would be rewarded over  
04:33 short-term cash grabs. The problem is that we have 
allowed our market system to reward some people in  
04:37 the short term and place long-term consequences 
somewhere else entirely. Over the last four  
04:42 decades, there have been three distinct changes 
that have slowly altered economic incentives  
04:46 to favor surviving to the next quarter above 
all else. The worst thing about all of this,  
04:51 though, is just how easy it would be to change 
these incentives back. So, it's time to learn  
04:56 how money works to find out if all of this 
is just the new way business gets done or if  
05:00 next quarter will eventually arrive. This week's 
video is sponsored by Vanta. Customer trust can

06:07 Now, maybe you think I have just picked a 
particularly egregious example of the buy now  
06:12 pay later industry, but this is just one symptom 
of a much larger and much more important trend.  
06:17 Everybody is just desperately trying to get theirs 
and get out. And you only need to look at the  
06:22 data to see the first reason why this has become 
the default business mentality. This is a chart  
06:28 of historic dividend yields from the S&P 500. 
There have been highs and lows, but for most of  
06:32 the market's history, it paid out roughly 4 to 5% 
and almost never less than 3%. This meant if you  
06:38 held a million-doll portfolio with a mix of all 
of these companies, you could expect to be paid  
06:43 between $40,000 and $50,000 a year in dividends. 
Today, after a constant decades long decline,  
06:49 that number is at an all-time low approaching just 
1%. In plain English, what this means is that the  
06:55 only way that people are realistically getting 
money out of the stock market is by selling their  
06:59 stocks. Now, by itself, there isn't anything 
wrong with capital gains returns over dividend  
07:03 returns from an investing point of view. Both of 
my good friends, Richard from the Plain Bagel and  
07:07 Ben Felix, have done great deep dives on this. 
What's more is that individually, the tax rate  
07:12 on capital gains are lower than tax rates on 
earned income like dividends. So maybe this  
07:17 could just be written off as businesses looking 
out for their own shareholders, but all of these  
07:21 small incentives have created some questionable 
outcomes. Now, I know you are probably already  
07:27 uttering the words stock buybacks under your 
breath right now, and you would be absolutely  
07:32 right. If a company has made a lot of money at the 
end of the year in the past, it only really had  
07:37 two options. The first was to just pay it out to 
their shareholders through a dividend. The second  
07:42 was to put that money back into the business to 
improve operations, work on R&D, or maybe even pay  
07:47 their employees a little bit better. Shareholders 
typically actually liked when companies did this  
07:52 because theoretically, this reinvestment would 
grow the business or make it more dominant in  
07:56 its market, making their shares more valuable. But 
then in 1982, a law was changed that let companies  
08:02 cut out the middleman of reinvesting their cash 
into their business's fundamentals and instead  
08:06 let them just directly invest their cash right 
into their business's equity. company management  
08:11 could take company money and use it to buy the 
company's own stock which boosted the price. Now,  
08:15 by looking at this chart, you can see where that 
law was passed right here. Again, this video is  
08:21 not to pick on stock buybacks in particular, but 
it is instead to show how small rule changes can  
08:26 fundamentally alter how our markets operate. 
Companies taking their money and buying back  
08:30 stock may not seem any different to companies 
taking their money and paying out dividends.  
08:35 But it means that to actually get money out of 
shares, people eventually need to sell them.  
08:39 Now, companies are theoretically only supposed 
to buy back their own shares when they think that  
08:43 they are undervalued in the market. But company 
management has figured out this weird trick where  
08:47 they can just always say that their company is 
undervalued and use these buybacks to boost the  
08:51 share price. And since their compensation 
is also usually tied to stock performance,  
08:56 it's a win-win. Today, this has created a 
situation that would be almost funny if it  
09:01 wasn't so concerning. A record number of CEOs are 
claiming that their company stock is undervalued,  
09:06 so they are doing big share buybacks. But then 
at the same time, they are personally cashing out  
09:10 records amount of their own stock at a price that 
they themselves have claimed is undervalued. For a  
09:16 lot of senior executives with performance-based 
pay, it simply makes sense to put a few good  
09:20 months on the books and liquidate as quickly 
as possible. Because if they can do that,  
09:24 they will never need to work again. Back when CEO 
pay was more modest and not as performance-based,  
09:30 the goal was instead to hold on to an executive 
job for as long as possible. The pay was still  
09:35 really good, but you couldn't live off the bonus 
that came from one good quarter. So, if you wanted  
09:39 to become truly wealthy, you needed to spend at 
least a decade in the top job. And to do that,  
09:44 you needed to make sure your company would run 
smoothly for that decade. Today, pay for top  
09:48 executives is so high that after one or two good 
years, they can cash out their equity holdings and  
09:53 not really need the job anymore. Ironically, when 
they do sell their shares, the person they are  
09:58 most likely selling to is their own company. Stock 
buybacks have become so widespread and been driven  
10:03 to such an extreme level that companies buying 
their own stock now accounts for basically all  
10:08 net buying activity in the market and then some. 
According to the Federal Reserve's Z1 financial  
10:13 accounts since the year 2000, households, foreign 
investors, and pension funds have on net actually  
10:18 sold about $300 billion more in stock than 
they have purchased. The inflow in capital has  
10:23 come exclusively from the $5.5 trillion in net 
purchases made by the corporations themselves.  
10:29 This whole game has starved genuine reinvestment 
into business activity because it's far more  
10:33 rewarding to just directly influence their own 
stock price. Now again, eventually this will cause  
10:38 problems, especially amongst the growing list of 
companies that have taken on debt to buy their  
10:42 own stock. But most shareholders simply don't care 
about the long-term because they are now holding  
10:47 on to their stock for less than a year on average. 
This trend has been accelerated a little bit by  
10:52 low cost brokerages like Robin Hood, but those 
people don't actually own enough of the market  
10:56 to have an influence this significant. The real 
driver of this is that large stockholders need  
11:01 to liquidate their positions to generate any kind 
of cash flow. Over the last 5 years in particular,  
11:06 we have witnessed a strange trend develop from 
this little game. People aren't making profit  
11:11 by running profitable businesses. They are making 
a profit by flipping assets that could eventually  
11:15 one day be profitable. A big determinant of how 
much these businesses are worth is interest rates.  
11:21 Cheap debt means borrowing to invest is easier and 
it means that cash flow becomes less important in  
11:26 the short term. What this has done has turned bad 
news into good news. In the past, something like  
11:31 bad job numbers would spook the market because if 
people don't have jobs, they can't buy stuff from  
11:36 businesses. And if businesses can't sell their 
stuff, they won't be profitable. But that way  
11:41 of thinking is very outdated in today's market. 
Today, bad job numbers means that the Fed might  
11:47 be forced to lower interest rates, which is way 
better for asset prices than something silly like  
11:52 genuine underlying business demand. Now, it's 
easy to just point at these companies and their  
11:56 executives and conclude that they are everything 
wrong with the world or at the very least the  
12:00 economy. But that's also not very productive. If 
we are being really honest with ourselves, if you  
12:06 or I got given a job as a Fortune 500 CEO and we 
could secure a generational fortune by doing some  
12:11 share buybacks, we would probably do it. I mean, I 
know I would. Feel free to pretend you are better  
12:17 than me though in the comment section below. The 
point is that all of this was simply the result of  
12:22 a few changes in rewards and regulations. 
People at all levels are overwhelmingly  
12:26 going to act in ways that conform to these 
guidelines. Yes, some groups and industries  
12:31 are really testing the limits of what is legal 
at the moment, but that's a separate issue.  
12:35 The bigger problem is that everything covered 
in this video so far is perfectly legal. Yes,  
12:40 we can absolutely do a better job of punishing 
people who fall outside these regulations when  
12:45 they do happen. But we also should not rely on 
people for going obvious personal rewards just  
12:50 because it's the right thing to do for society 
at large. Now, it probably doesn't help that the  
12:54 people making regulations and rules are very much 
at the you got mine stage of their life at the  
12:59 moment. But go and watch this video next to find 
out how this short-term thinking has moved well  
13:03 beyond financial markets. And don't forget to like
