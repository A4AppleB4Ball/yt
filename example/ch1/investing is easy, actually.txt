00:00 When it comes to gambling, a popular
00:02 saying is that the house has the edge,
00:05 which means the odds are mathematically
00:07 in the casino's favor. Investing in
00:09 stocks is pretty similar, except Black
00:11 Rockck has the edge. Luckily for us,
00:14 though, there are plenty of investing
00:15 techniques out there that are basically
00:17 guaranteed to make you a profit over the
00:19 long term. You won't learn it from
00:21 school. You also won't learn it from the
00:22 bot comments under every finance video
00:24 advertising an AI generated ebook with
00:27 an AI generated cover and summary on the
00:29 back. In reality, investing is actually
00:31 one of the few skills in life that is
00:33 best learned from people who are really,
00:36 really bad at it. As in, they
00:38 transferred their entire life savings
00:39 into a Robin Hood account, funneled half
00:41 that money into one penny stock, and of
00:43 course, to manage risk, they put the
00:46 other half into an explosive tech
00:47 company that's gone up 50% in the last
00:50 month. A common theme with bad investors
00:52 is that they invest in stocks not just
00:54 with their money, but with their
00:56 emotions. On top of that, they tell you
00:58 every quarter that the company will
00:59 start making profit next quarter and
01:01 that they themselves have come up with
01:03 an advanced stock forecasting model that
01:06 predicts the price is going to shoot up
01:07 in a matter of days. And maybe they're
01:09 right, maybe they're wrong. But the
01:11 reason why you should learn from these
01:13 people is cuz they'll teach you that
01:15 either one of two things happen. Either
01:17 you lose 80% of your money and then you
01:19 lose the other 20% trying to make back
01:21 what you just lost. or you get lucky and
01:23 double your money and then you lose
01:25 everything by trying to double it again
01:27 with a different stock. Indeed, the main
01:29 difference between a 1,00% return
01:31 investor versus a negative 100% return
01:33 investor is neither skill nor strategy.
01:36 It's what four-letter acronym they
01:38 decided to gamble on. It might be
01:40 tempting to think this guy is a genius
01:42 investor, but let's say I go to a
01:44 roulette table and I put $10,000 on
01:46 green, which by the way only has a 2.63%
01:50 chance of winning. And then let's say
01:51 the ball actually lands on green, which
01:53 means I 35x my money and I get a
01:55 $350,000 payout. That doesn't make me a
01:58 good gambler. I just picked the one
02:00 color it happened to land on one time.
02:03 Doesn't mean I should teach you how to
02:04 play roulette. Now, before we get into
02:06 investing, you may be extremely worried
02:07 about the AI bubble. Perhaps you have
02:09 nightmares about a 2027 recession solely
02:12 caused by one of the urinals at the
02:14 Nvidia headquarters not getting flushed.
02:16 In that case, the investing method
02:18 that'll keep you safe in almost every
02:19 scenario is a method devised by John C.
02:22 Bogle, the founder and former CEO of
02:24 Vanguard, who beat the odds as the first
02:26 person to simultaneously own an
02:28 investment company while also being
02:30 generally considered as a good guy. He's
02:32 estimated to have saved investors about
02:34 a trillion dollars in fees while letting
02:36 Vanguard's profits go to its
02:38 shareholders rather than himself. This
02:40 resulted in his net worth in 2019 being
02:43 only 80 million, which is less than
02:45 Barbara from Shark Tank. And for that
02:47 reason, I'm out here reading his book,
02:49 The Little Common Sense Book of
02:51 Investing, using today's sponsor, Short
02:53 Form. Short Form is available on your
02:55 phone or on your desktop as a pretty
02:57 much neverending library of non-fiction
02:59 books, which you can access full guides
03:01 to at any time. If you don't find
03:03 yourself having the time to read or you
03:05 want information on a topic quickly,
03:07 this will help you like it helped me.
03:08 For example, just looking up Bogle in
03:10 the search bar gave me four different
03:12 books talking about his investment
03:13 style. Short Form has many, many other
03:16 books on investing, but these ones are
03:18 where I recommend you start cuz they
03:20 introduce the passive threeund portfolio
03:22 that beats pretty much everything else.
03:24 One US total market index fund, one
03:27 international total market index fund,
03:29 and one bond index fund. If you've
03:31 always wanted to become smarter, and if
03:32 you've always wanted to read more, this
03:34 is an actually realistic way you can do
03:36 it and stick to it. So, sign up

03:52 Now, with that in mind, what is the best
03:53 way to invest? Well, the best
03:55 investment, of course, is the one that
03:57 brings you the most happiness. In the
03:59 financial world, this equates to
04:00 whatever investment makes you the most
04:02 money. So, when people tell you that
04:03 index funds like these ones are the best
04:05 investment, they're kind of wrong
04:07 because you could have always just
04:08 bought Dogecoin in 2020 and sold it in
04:10 2021 for a 35,000% return. But the
04:14 chance that you actually do pick the
04:16 best investment or even a good
04:17 investment is pretty low. What you want
04:20 instead is an optimal investment. And
04:22 that's what people mean when they say
04:24 index funds like the ones I just
04:26 mentioned are the best because they are
04:27 very close to the optimal investment
04:29 based on available research, historical
04:32 data, and mathematical models. They're
04:34 predictable way to get a high expected
04:36 return for quite low amount of risk. But
04:38 there is still risk. Usually, no one
04:41 ever explains this and they make index
04:42 funds seem like the safe option made for
04:44 librarians who drink chamomile tea and
04:46 play board games on Friday nights. No,
04:49 index funds are risky, but the high
04:51 expected return makes it one of the few
04:53 times in investing where taking more
04:55 risk is mathematically worth it. Risk is
04:58 the possibility that the actual return
04:60 of an investment will be different from
05:01 its expected return. Expected return is
05:04 exactly what it sounds like. If the
05:06 expected return of an investment is 5%
05:08 per year, you're of course not
05:09 guaranteed to get 5% a year. But if you
05:12 simulate 14,605
05:14 different universes and you made the
05:16 same investment in each universe, the
05:18 average return would be 5%. If the risk
05:20 is zero, that means every single
05:22 simulation would give you a 5% return.
05:24 Exactly. But as you increase the risk,
05:27 now the possible spread of outcomes is
05:29 wider. If you keep increasing the risk,
05:31 eventually you get to a point where
05:32 you're risking 100% loss for the chance
05:35 to double your money. A real world
05:37 example of this is any stock with
05:39 therapeutics in its name. The core thing
05:41 you should know about investing is that
05:43 sometimes taking on more risk increases
05:46 your expected return. Let's start with
05:48 cash. Cash in your wallet or cash in the
05:50 bank is very reliable. However, the
05:52 trade-off is that your money just sits
05:54 there with a 0% yearly return while
05:56 inflation is making your money 2 to 3%
05:59 less valuable every year. Inflation will
06:01 be here forever. You should expect
06:03 inflation to never go away. In 2077,
06:06 assuming Chipotle still exists, a
06:08 Chipotle burrito will be about $50 or
06:11 more. And it's not even a question, it's
06:12 a guarantee. Come back to this video in
06:14 2077 and you can verify that. So, if
06:17 you're not earning at least a 2 to 3%
06:19 return every year, the purchasing power
06:20 of your money is going down. You can
06:22 increase your expected return a little
06:24 more with bonds and treasuries. When you
06:26 buy a bond, you're lending money to
06:28 usually your government or a company for
06:30 a long fixed period of time. Government
06:32 bonds are not that risky, but they might
06:34 be a little less liquid than money in a
06:36 savings account. So for that, you're
06:38 compensated with a higher return around
06:40 4%. Corporate bonds are a little
06:42 riskier, but that increased risk is
06:44 compensated with an increased expected
06:46 return of five or even 6 7%.
06:51 But the investment that's generally
06:53 considered to be the best risk-to-reward
06:55 ratio is the stock market. Historically,
06:58 the total United States stock market has
06:60 returned about 10% a year. And even if
07:02 you think US companies are overvalued
07:04 right now, current projections still
07:06 calculate the expected return to be
07:08 about 8 to 9% per year in the long term.
07:11 One of the easiest and most optimal ways
07:13 to capture these returns is to buy a
07:15 total market index fund that holds a
07:17 giant basket of stocks. For example, VTI
07:20 is an index fund made by Vanguard that
07:22 holds 3,500 US stocks, which is
07:25 basically every single US stock that you
07:27 can buy. It's important to know that
07:29 they're weighted by market cap. Market
07:31 cap is the share price of a company
07:33 times the number of available shares.
07:35 And this can be thought of as the amount
07:37 you would have to pay in theory if you
07:39 wanted to buy and own the company 100%
07:41 for yourself. Inside this index fund and
07:44 most index funds, the majority of your
07:46 money will be invested into companies
07:47 with really high market caps. For
07:49 example, according to Vanguard's
07:51 website, if you put $10,000 into the VTI
07:54 index fund, 713 would go into Nvidia,
07:57 612 into Apple, 587 into Microsoft, and
08:02 350 into Amazon. But then smaller
08:04 companies like T-Mobile and Starbucks
08:06 only get $14 each. Now, this might seem
08:09 too concentrated in a few big companies.
08:12 This may lead you to look around for
08:13 other ETFs to invest in. ETFs are
08:16 baskets of stocks that you can invest in
08:17 with just one ticker symbol. Many have
08:19 themes or specific objectives like small
08:21 cap index funds, midcap index funds,
08:24 value ETFs, factor growth, equal weight,
08:27 sector specific, gold, Bitcoin, double
08:30 leveraged, triple leveraged, quadruple
08:32 leveraged, bonds, income, and some
08:35 actively managed ETFs that promise to
08:37 beat the market or a lower risk. While
08:39 some of these can be wise investments to
08:41 be more diversified, some are a bit more
08:43 questionable. At the end of the day
08:45 though, all that matters is the total
08:47 return you get. And if your questionable
08:49 ETF outperforms a total market cap
08:51 weighted lowcost index fund, then good
08:53 for you. Just know though that's much
08:55 easier to panic sell an investment that
08:58 you know is questionable and risky
08:60 versus investment that's already been
09:02 proven to work over time. It might feel
09:04 pretty easy to beat an index fund by
09:06 yoloing all your money into individual
09:08 big tech stocks or even stocks where the
09:10 graph just looks right. The problem
09:12 comes from trying to replicate that
09:14 every single year for a long time. You
09:16 may beat the index one year, but if you
09:18 want to beat it 40 years in a row, it's
09:20 virtually impossible. Or it is possible,
09:23 you're just not going to do it. If you
09:25 have money you want to invest in stocks,
09:27 put it in a portfolio that will cover
09:28 the entire stock market, even
09:30 international stocks. And to protect
09:32 yourself in bad times, also some bonds.
09:34 It'll feel risky, especially since your
09:36 portfolio value will swing up and down.
09:39 But over the long term, that risk is
09:41 compensated by an expected annual return
09:44 that is much higher than anything you
09:45 can get anywhere else. Lastly, if you're
09:48 going to hold an ETF for a long time,
09:50 make sure to choose something with low
09:51 fees, also called expense ratios, cuz
09:54 those fees compound over time. The stock
09:57 market is very easy to predict. Some
09:59 people will beat the market index's
10:00 returns for one or two years in a row.
10:03 Some people will lose everything trying
10:04 to beat it and then they'll borrow money
10:06 to try and make back what they lost and
10:08 then lose that too. Other people will
10:10 forget for years that they even have an
10:12 investment account, but still outperform
10:14 99% of the day traders who think
10:16 investing can replace a job. You don't
10:18 want to be a day trader. You want to be
10:20 the person who makes day traders mad.
