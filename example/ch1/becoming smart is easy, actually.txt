00:00 so you want to become smart in most of
00:02 the world you're told that it takes 12
00:04 years of school plus 4 years of college
00:07 plus 6 years of graduate school to
00:09 become smart but what you actually
00:11 become is homeless that's not even a
00:13 joke but on the bright side when you
00:16 make a Reddit post about how you can't
00:17 get a job you can do it in perfect
00:19 English if you haven't guessed by the
00:21 title becoming smart is actually very
00:24 easy even if you think your genetics
00:26 make you dumb if you compare yourself to
00:28 every other animal you're actually
00:29 pretty over powered when people like you
00:31 and me say we want to get smarter it
00:34 means a bunch of things we want to learn
00:36 useful skills ideally skills that make
00:38 money we want to be good at solving
00:40 problems hopefully for money we want to
00:43 get better geds and learn difficult
00:44 subjects to make more money and also to
00:47 flex on people and lastly we want to
00:49 sound smart in conversation just enough
00:52 so people respect you but not too much
00:54 to the point where people think you're a
00:55 nerd the problem is most advice on the
00:58 Internet is so vague and philosophical
01:01 that even if it works the only people
01:02 who could actually follow it are Oprah
01:05 and Socrates and if you instead look for
01:07 specific advice that you can actually
01:09 try right now this is what you get eat
01:12 blueberries cuz they brain food drink
01:14 black coffee exercise sleep more take IQ
01:18 tests listen to classical music these
01:21 things sound good but at some point you
01:23 have to you know actually learn stuff
01:25 besides even in the past there have been
01:27 some Geniuses who have spent the whole
01:29 day sitting at a desk desk getting 2 to
01:31 4 hours of sleep a day so what can you
01:33 actually do to get smarter that's not
01:35 just the same six brain hacks from a
01:37 Facebook post copied and pasted from a
01:39 Wiki how article inspired by a quote
01:41 spray painted on a New York Subway wall
01:44 the main thing you need to do is read
01:46 what kind of reading it depends fiction
01:48 is good for learning to read faster and
01:50 it gives you a better vocabulary also if
01:53 you read a lot of dialogue it makes you
01:55 feel like you have friends but most
01:57 people go straight for non-fiction which
01:59 indeed is the key to being able to
02:01 casually drop interesting knowledge in
02:03 conversations for example just by
02:05 reading this book you can come off to
02:07 anyone in conversation as someone who
02:09 knows history the key is to not be
02:12 obnoxious about it crazy how we evolved
02:14 from chimpanzees right well actually
02:17 evolution is nonlinear and several human
02:20 like species inhabited Earth
02:22 simultaneously none of which could even
02:24 be remotely considered as chimpanzees
02:27 while this is considered polite by the
02:28 standards of a YouTube comment section
02:30 in real life saying well actually before
02:33 proving someone wrong will make you
02:35 instantly unlikable change the well to
02:38 an easy and now we're talking let's redo
02:40 that conversation crazy how we evolved
02:43 from chimpanzees right it is crazy right
02:46 you know I was reading the other day and
02:47 apparently humans and
02:50 chimpanzees I always thought we evolved
02:52 from them but I guess we just evolved
02:54 side by side you can be smart while also
02:57 being humble and also sounding like you
02:59 touch grass the key is to teach people
03:01 what you know without making them sound
03:04 dumb this way people will actually learn
03:06 from you which will make them see you as
03:09 smart and respectable now how do you
03:11 find these books it's actually really
03:13 easy you don't have to read the same
03:15 five books everyone tells you to read
03:17 just think of a topic you want to learn
03:19 about like cleaning now Google books
03:23 about cleaning here's one that looks
03:24 good usually these books cost money but
03:27 if your finger slips you might
03:29 accidentally end up on this website and
03:31 you might accidentally search for the
03:32 title of the book and by chance click on
03:35 the first link and oh no accidentally
03:37 downloaded a file and opened it with the
03:40 appropriate ebook viewer well now that
03:42 you have the book you'll also find that
03:44 not only can you pick out interesting
03:46 tidbits to use in conversations but you
03:48 can also learn many useful skills there
03:51 are 10 things you should know before you
03:53 learn a skill one unless you practice
03:55 the skill your brain will think it's
03:57 useless and forget it two you only have
03:60 have to know 20% of the knowledge to
04:02 master 80% of the skill so I guess we
04:05 could just move on this is called the
04:07 learning curve it's a graph of how good
04:09 you get at a skill over time as you can
04:12 see just by practicing a little bit you
04:14 can make a lot of progress in the
04:16 beginning but you have to practice no
04:18 one ever learned how to tie a tie by
04:20 watching how to tie a tie you only learn
04:23 how to tie a tie by watching how to tie
04:25 a tie while tying a tie the same applies
04:28 to reading books only make you smarter
04:30 if you give your brain a reason to
04:31 remember the stuff in the book so once
04:33 you read the chapter on cleaning a
04:35 bedroom go ahead and clean a bedroom
04:37 doesn't even have to be your bedroom
04:39 just clean one and now you'll never
04:41 forget it but let's just imagine that's
04:43 something that you can't practice right
04:45 now like imagine you're reading a book
04:47 about cars and then you see this diagram
04:49 of how to jump start a dead car with a
04:51 good car ideally you'll read about it
04:54 and then go practice it but not everyone
04:56 has two cars lying around to practice on
04:59 but you can still practice it by just
05:01 imagining imagine the moment where
05:03 you'll need to know how to jump start a
05:04 car put yourself in the situation find a
05:07 video and pretend that's your car by
05:10 imagining the whole process from start
05:12 to finish you just convinced your brain
05:14 that you used all that information and
05:17 now you'll remember it meanwhile the
05:19 person who just looked at the diagram
05:21 and tried to memorize it still won't
05:23 know what to do if they ever had to jump
05:24 start a car this is how you get smart
05:27 use everything you learn and if you can
05:30 imagine yourself in the moment where
05:32 it'll be useful this is basically how
05:34 the entire school system works you learn
05:36 a piece of information and because it'll
05:38 be like 15 years before you actually use
05:40 it your teacher creates an imaginary
05:43 situation where that information is
05:45 useful that is a test an exam that has
05:48 questions on that exact piece of
05:50 information and if you get it wrong you
05:52 fail or in South Korea you get prison
05:56 time just kidding that's only if you
05:58 cheat this is usually in enough to make
06:00 your brain at least attempt to remember
06:02 the information the only problem is once
06:05 the test is over your brain says it's
06:07 not useful anymore and you forget it
06:09 some people think repetition or space
06:11 repetition or studying in intervals or
06:13 mind mapping will help them get better
06:15 grades and learn faster but in reality
06:18 doing practice questions will give you
06:20 the most results because they simulate
06:22 the actual situation in which you'll
06:24 need to use what you learned if you
06:26 don't have any practice questions make
06:28 your own and convince yourself that the
06:30 stakes are high like pretend that you're
06:32 hanging off a cliff by one arm and
06:34 someone's there to pull you up but only
06:36 if you can name all the parts of a human
06:39 cell learning information and making it
06:42 seem useful to your brain is all you
06:44 need to get smart and this is why
06:46 textbooks are the S tier format for
06:48 becoming smart as fast as possible
06:51 there's no fluff no handholding no
06:53 distractions just pure information and a
06:55 bunch of practice questions and if you
06:57 can't solve them you have to flip all
06:59 the way to page XXX VV I II in the
07:03 appendix to get help textbooks aren't
07:06 for the Casual learner because it's not
07:08 as fun as watching a YouTube video on
07:09 the topic and forgetting it all an hour
07:12 later but if you're ever up to the
07:14 challenge there is a website you might
07:16 accidentally end up on where you could
07:18 accidentally download free textbooks on
07:20 any subject you want but before you do
07:22 that I'm collecting donations in the
07:24 form of subscribes to fund the next
