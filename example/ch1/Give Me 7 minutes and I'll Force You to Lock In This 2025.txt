00:00 since Co a lot has changed the world
00:03 isn't the same as it used to be but not
00:05 exactly in a good way everything became
00:08 gray and pretty much colorless but so
00:10 did we somewhere along the way we
00:12 collectively lost a bit of spark and if
00:14 you're honest with yourself you probably
00:16 feel it too every New Year rolls around
00:19 and we always hear the same thing next
00:21 year will be my year for real except it
00:24 wasn't not in 2023 not in 2024 and it
00:28 won't be in 2025 either unless you force
00:31 it to be so spare me a bit of your time
00:34 and I'll force you to lock in for 2025
00:36 but just a quick disclaimer I'm not here
00:38 to motivate you motivation is a sugar
00:40 rush and I'm obviously not selling candy
00:43 I'm here to give you the tools
00:45 perspective and kick in the teeth you
00:47 need to make this your actual year like
00:49 for real now I'm not going to be too
00:51 hard on you I know you've been trying or
00:54 at least you think you have maybe you
00:56 started a bulking plan but quit after
00:58 two weeks because life got busy or you
01:01 set goals but they were vague enough to
01:03 be ignored like I want to be better
01:05 better at what breathing you've been
01:08 doing that since birth see trying isn't
01:10 enough if you're half assing it you're
01:12 not failing because life is unfair even
01:15 though yeah it is you're failing because
01:17 you're waiting for life to miraculously
01:19 align itself around your Vibes but it
01:21 won't you're the one who's got to align
01:24 themselves with their goals and to align
01:26 yourself you'll need to start where it
01:27 matters most your time you're probably
01:31 used to saying I don't have time that's
01:33 funny because you had time to scroll Tik
01:35 Tok for 3 hours yesterday you had time
01:37 to rewatch the same show for the fourth
01:39 time because it's absolute Cinema you
01:42 had time to stare at the ceiling
01:43 thinking about how you have no time did
01:46 you see it you have time you're just bad
01:49 at using it if we do the math you have
01:51 24 hours in a day let's say you sleep
01:54 for 8 hours if you're lucky work or
01:56 college for up to 8 as well and spend 2
01:59 hours eating and existing that leaves 6
02:02 hours now ask yourself what am I doing
02:05 with them if you can't answer that
02:07 without stuttering you found your
02:09 problem look we live in an era where you
02:11 can learn literally anything for free or
02:14 close to it feel like starting a
02:16 business there are tutorials templates
02:18 and even AI tools that'll practically
02:21 walk you through the process getting fit
02:23 or shredded there are apps YouTube
02:25 channels and communities that will keep
02:27 you accountable learning a new skill
02:29 platforms like corsera skillshare or
02:32 even Tik Tok if you're following the
02:33 right creators have you covered so why
02:36 are you using your phone to scroll
02:38 aimlessly instead of using it to level
02:40 up or clicking that subscribe button
02:42 below this video technology isn't the
02:44 enemy here you are your phone is a tool
02:48 but if you treat it like a toy it'll
02:49 treat you like a joke but even then
02:51 tools are just tools they're still
02:53 pretty useless without a plan which
02:54 brings us to my next Point systems
02:57 saying I want to save money is cute but
02:60 what's your your plan are you tracking
03:01 expenses automating savings or are you
03:04 just hoping your bank account will
03:05 surprise you like a physics exam on
03:07 Monday the same goes for Fitness
03:09 learning relationships everything goals
03:12 are basically useless without systems
03:15 systems are what make you show up on the
03:17 days you don't feel like it they're the
03:18 boring routines that actually get
03:20 results they're the meal preps the study
03:22 schedules the workout plans they're what
03:24 separate the people who achieve from the
03:26 people who talk about achieving and
03:28 while we're at it let's quickly address
03:30 the ugly grind and why you should
03:32 embrace it most of what will make you
03:34 successful is not exciting it's boring
03:37 it's repetitive it's waking up early to
03:38 work out when you'd rather sleep it's
03:41 saying no to plans so you can study it's
03:44 putting in effort when no one's clapping
03:45 for you the grind isn't supposed to feel
03:47 good it's supposed to feel necessary and
03:50 the sooner you stop expecting every step
03:52 to be fun the sooner you'll start seeing
03:54 results of course the grind doesn't have
03:56 to be the good oldfashioned way times
03:58 changed you need to be aware and
04:00 recognize the massive potential and
04:02 opportunities sitting right in front of
04:04 you but you know what else is massive we
04:06 are now living in the most resource Rich
04:08 era of all time there's no excuse for
04:10 being ignorant or stagnant you want to
04:12 make more money lots of money- making
04:14 opportunities are everywhere you want to
04:16 learn coding public speaking singing
04:18 dancing drawing editing animating
04:21 writing talking to girls touching grass
04:23 free tutorials exist you want to get
04:25 better at anything Google it even if
04:28 it's not always accurate you'll still
04:29 learn something do you see it now you're
04:32 not struggling because there's a lack of
04:34 opportunities you're struggling because
04:36 you're not grabbing them and no
04:37 scrolling through success content isn't
04:39 the same as actually taking action you
04:42 might be watching this video and
04:43 listening to my advice but are you
04:45 actually putting in the work stop being
04:47 a boring passive consumer of inspiration
04:49 and start being an active participant in
04:51 your own life that being said there's
04:53 still one problem you see people avoid
04:55 taking real action because of this one
04:58 particular idea of balance you've been
05:00 sold this idea that you can balance
05:02 everything perfectly work life growth
05:05 rest actually it's not that easy and
05:08 it's kind of overrated too if you want
05:10 something badly enough you have to let
05:12 other things slide collapse descend
05:15 plummet that doesn't mean burning out
05:17 but it does mean prioritizing like your
05:19 life depends on it because it kind of
05:21 does you're not going to achieve your
05:23 goals by squeezing them into the cracks
05:24 of your schedule they need to be front
05:26 and center not an afterthought and in
05:29 order to be able to do that you need to
05:30 answer one big question am I really
05:33 trying because it's easy to say you're
05:35 trying but are you really or are you
05:37 just dabbling there's a difference
05:39 between effort and consistent effort one
05:42 gets you short-term results if that and
05:45 the other transforms your life be honest
05:47 with yourself if you are not where you
05:50 want to be is it because the world is
05:51 against you or is it because you are not
05:54 fully in that mentality are you you
05:57 because you're the lamest or are you the
05:59 lamest because you're you you can't half
06:02 commit and then expect full results I'm
06:05 not saying this is someone perfect
06:06 because I'm not but I can confidently
06:09 say I'm the best version of myself that
06:11 I've ever been and a big part of that is
06:13 because I stopped waiting for life to
06:15 hand me success and started forcing it
06:17 anyways my point is if I could do that
06:19 what's the reason you can't I mean I'm
06:21 pretty sure you and I are not so
06:22 different look this is just a wakeup
06:24 call a reminder I'm not going to end
06:26 this by saying something cheesy like
06:28 you've got this you might not have this
06:31 that's up to you but what I can say is
06:33 that if you decide to lock in like
06:35 really lock in 2025 can be the year you
06:38 stop saying next year will be my year
06:40 for real and start saying this year is
06:44 mine the world isn't going to fix itself
06:46 for you it's gray and colorless and that
06:49 sucks but you you're smart you're strong
06:53 you're adaptable and most of all you're
06:55 a CutiePie you can fix yourself and
06:57 maybe that'll bring a little color back
06:59 in everything else too so are you in or
07:02 are we having the same conversation next
07:04 year I mean you tell me
