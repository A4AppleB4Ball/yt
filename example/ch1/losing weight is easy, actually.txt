00:00 People usally think losing weight is 
about half diet and half excercise,
00:05 but both of those combined are only about 
25% of it, Another 25% is good quality sleep,
00:11 and the other--500 percent—is actually 
doing what you said you would.
00:16 Luckily, if you start a diet 
right now, there is a way,
00:19 an easy way, to make it almost impossible to fail.
00:22 Step 1 is to get inspired. There's always a spark 
that makes you decide you wanna change, and it’s
00:28 usually seeing someone else who’s way more 
fit than you, or seeing yourself in a picture.
00:32 Either way, inspiration is strong, but only 
ever lasts for a day, and then it’s gone. So
00:37 what you need next, is a realistic goal that 
you can measure, as well as a time you need to
00:42 achieve it by. For example, “I’m going to lose 
5 pounds by July 1st, and another 5 pounds by
00:49 August 1st” is something you can measure, and 
it even has a checkpoint to keep you motivated.
00:54 Then the next thing you need is a detailed and 
realistic plan that will get you to your goal. The
00:59 plan might just be to replace your daily breakfast 
of milk, sugary granola and a peanut butter jelly
01:04 sandwich, with instead a 1-mile jog, followed by 
a bowl of 15 big strawberries and 3 boiled eggs,.
01:11 Believe it or not, this one change is more than
01:14 enough for you to lose multiple 
pounds of fat in just a few weeks.
01:18 But having the plan is not enough.
01:20 You need to set everything up, so 
that you can easily follow the plan.
01:23 You have to buy the strawberries, and boil the 
eggs the night before, and get your running
01:28 clothes ready, so that when you wake up, the 
easiest thing to do is just stick to the plan.
01:33 If you don’t boil the eggs, and you keep 
buying peanut butter and grape jelly and
01:37 you keep putting them at the front of the 
fridge where it's the first thing you see,
01:40 than that means you don't actually intend 
to stick to your diet. You’re just looking
01:44 forward to that one day when you give in 
and make your high calorie breakfast again.
01:48 If you want to make it easy to eat healthy, 
then make it hard to eat junk food.
01:53 Of course, that’s easy to say, but no matter how 
much you try to avoid even looking at junk food,
01:58 you need to expect that there will be hard times.
02:01 Like when you accidentally trip and 
fall face first into a booth at IHOP,
02:05 you see that every item is 
over a thousand calories,
02:07 and you get the temptation to say five of 
the most dangerous words in diet history.
02:12 You can pick from any of the following options.
02:15 A. “One cheat meal won’t hurt”
02:17 B. “I’ll *actually* start 
dieting tomorrow” ←never do this
02:20 C. “I just won’t eat later”
02:22 D. “Maybe I’ll just start bulking”
02:24 And its times like this when you need willpower. 
Which is the ability to tell yourself no.
02:29 You can build up your willpower 
by anticipating all the excuses
02:32 you’re gonna make, and practicing saying 
no to all of them. You can even practice
02:37 walking away from bad choices. But keep 
in mind that willpower isn’t infinite,
02:41 so you can’t always rely on it. You're better off 
just avoiding the temptation in the first place.
02:47 Finally, the real cheat code to motivation,
02:49 is doing something for so 
long that it becomes a habit.
02:52 If you can get to the point where you wake 
up and automatically go outside for a jog,
02:57 and you automatically reach for the strawberries 
and boiled eggs, then the plan becomes a hundred
03:02 times easier to follow, and it'll keep 
getting easier every day you do it.
03:06 Eventually, you might even start to **like** 
eating healthy and excercising, at which point,
03:10 like for many other people, it’s no 
longer a lifestyle choice, but instead,
03:14 your entire personality. And 
this is the ultimate goal.
03:18 Anyway, let's move on to the basics of fat loss.
03:21 There’s no real accurate way to 
track it besides progress pictures,
03:24 and weighing yourself once a week.
03:26 For the progress pictures, just know that you 
won’t see much change in the first few weeks,
03:31 and maybe not even in the first few months,
03:33 because your body first prioritizes losing 
fat from places that you probably can’t see.
03:38 But once you start seeing visual progress,
03:40 it starts to become more and 
more noticeable very quickly.
03:44 So to *really* measure your progress, you should 
step on a scale maybe once every morning. Just
03:49 know that it can fluctuate a lot based on 
water weight, or the types of foods you eat.
03:53 Which means, you might lose a pound of fat, 
but your weight might not change right away.
03:57 So instead of looking at your day-to-day progress, 
just look at your average week-to-week progress.
04:03 So you’ve probably heard that to lose 
fat over time, you have to eat less
04:06 calories than you burn. That means if 
your body burns 2000 calories a day,
04:11 then eating 1700 calories a day will make 
you lose fat. That’s because the body will
04:15 use energy from fat. and a teeny tiny bit of 
muscle to help cover the 300 calorie defecit.
04:22 And if you drop your calories even lower, to 1500 
or even 1200 a day, you’ll lose fat more quickly,
04:29 but at the expense of it being way 
more difficult for you to maintain.
04:32 The traditional, optimal way to figure out how
04:35 many calories you should be eating is 
to use a online calorie calculator.
04:39 Activity level sedentary....why lie,
04:42 And then eat around this number, every 
day, as a starting point to lose weight.
04:46 But it’s worth noting that this number can 
be way off since everyone has a different
04:50 metabolism. And it can be especially 
off for people with hormonal problems.
04:54 high cortisol, low estrogen/testosterone, 
low thyroid hormones
04:54 So the best way to know for sure 
is to start with this number,
04:58 and then see how your weight changes over the 
next few weeks. If you find that each week,
05:02 your weight is not changing, then you need to 
lower your daily calories by another 200-300.
05:08 And if you ever reach a point where you 
haven’t lost any weight for at least a week,
05:12 you’ll either need to reduce your calories again, 
or you could also just add in some more excercise.
05:17 Now for some people, this method works perfectly 
because in theory, you can’t go wrong with it.
05:23 The only problem is, you have to count 
exactly how many calories you eat per day,
05:27 using nutrition labels, calorie counting 
apps, mental math, and also food scales,
05:32 which measure exactly how much of 
each food you’re eating in grams.
05:36 If you’re American, you might not 
be familiar with the metric system,
05:40 but you don’t have to worry, since the 
McDonald’s menu already has calorie counts.
05:45 Anyway, you can also get away with 
just roughly estimating your calories,
05:49 but this only really works if you play it 
safe and round everything up like crazy.
05:53 if you think it’s 300 calories it’s probably 500,
05:57 if you think it’s 800 
calories, it’s probably 1000.
05:60 And if you think it’s too small to 
count, it’s probably at least 50.
06:04 So before we get into the method where 
you don’t have to track anything at all,
06:07 we need to talk about macronutrients. Whether 
you track them or not, a lot of people want
06:10 to know how much protein, carbs, and fat 
they should eat per day. And to be honest,
06:15 for most weight loss purposes, all you 
need to look at is calories and protein.
06:20 You need a certain amount of 
protein, a certain amount of fats,
06:23 and then you can fill in the rest 
of your calories with anything.
06:26 Just make sure for fats, not to overeat stuff like 
oil, sauces, salad dressings, butter, nuts, and
06:32 cheese. Because even though these are healthy in 
moderate amounts, fats have 9 calories per gram,
06:38 which means one pack of trail mix has about 
3 times the calories of a dying neutron star.
06:43 Also, if you’ve ever heard weight loss 
experts say that carbs cause weight gain,
06:47 they’re not talking about fruits and 
vegetables and fiber and whole grains.
06:51 They’re talking about refined, highly processed 
carbs that are usually very delicious and are
06:57 stripped of most, if not all of their nutrients 
when they’re being processed. Especially
07:01 foods with lots of added sugars. Here are some 
examples. *Did you catch that, subtitle reader?
07:05 You’ll notice that this is 
basically the entire grocery store.
07:08 The problem with these is that they’re 
unnaturally delicious, easy to overeat,
07:13 they have lots of calories, and they 
just end up making you hungrier.
07:16 Of course, you can still have them everyday,
07:19 and you’ll still lose weight 
if you’re in a calorie deficit.
07:21 Which is why some people like to brag about how 
they can eat a family size box of reeses puffs
07:26 every day and still lose weight. What they don’t 
tell you is that they have an empty void in their
07:31 stomach for 23 hours a day, their bloodwork 
comes back with just a giant crying emoji,
07:36 and simply adding milk to their cereal takes them 
out of a calorie deficit, so they have use water.
07:41 And that brings us to the method how 
to lose fat without counting calories.
07:46 The Number One trick is to just start slowly 
eating more minimally processed foods,
07:51 avoiding junk, chips, sugary desserts, stuff 
with lots of refined carbs, and instead swapping
07:57 that out for fruits, vegetables, lean dairy, 
lean protein, healthy fats, and whole grains.
08:03 You’ll find that these foods are so 
filling and nutritious that you can
08:06 eat in a calorie deficit every single 
day without having to feel that hungry.
08:11 If you don’t believe me, this is 200 calories of 
oreos, and this is 200 calories of strawberries.
08:17 Another tip is to just stop 
snacking, and only eat during
08:20 meals. It’s ok to snack on fruits and vegetables, 
and maybe even some low-calorie diet snacks like
08:21 these if you really get cravings, but most 
people snack on high calorie, tasty junk food,
08:24 because they’re bored, stressed, or 
thirsty, not cause they’re hungry.
08:28 So cutting out snacks is actually one of the 
easiest things you can do, since the body
08:32 doesn’t really need them anyway. And overtime, 
you’ll just stop getting the urge to snack.
08:37 Ideally, once this happens, you’ll start to 
slowly develop a feeling of “i’m better than
08:41 everyone else,” which should be enough to 
keep you going till the end of your diet.
08:46 But in case times get hard, 
here are some more tips.
08:49 Number 1: start drinking lots of water. 
Water is very filling and half of the time,
08:54 when you’re hungry, a quick drink of 
water will get rid of the feeling.
08:57 Just keep a big water bottle next to you and 
you’ll never forget. This will also prevent
09:01 you from craving high calorie drinks like 
soda, juice, bubble tea, and milkshakes.
09:08 Number 2: If you keep saying, "The real diet 
starts tomorrow!" Then it'll never start.
09:15 Number 3: avoid liquid calories! 
It’s way easier to drink lots of
09:19 calories in the form of sugary 
drinks than it is to eat them.
09:22 Number 4: Low-fat shredded cheese, keto 
bread, cauliflower rice, eggwhites,
09:28 and even peanut butter powder are 
low-calorie swaps you can make.
09:32 Number 5: you can make healthy meals like this 
and this taste good with 0-calorie condiments and
09:38 spices and sauces and 0-calorie sweeteners. 
But don’t overuse them because in general,
09:44 the tastier your food is, the more 
cravings you’ll get for tasty food.
09:48 Number 6: Use zero-calorie diet sodas to 
your advantage, if you have sweet cravings.
09:53 Number 7: eat high volume, high fiber foods 
that fill up your stomach but are low calorie.
09:60 number 8: eat around 3 to 5 meals a day, since it 
helps you avoid long periods of feeling hungry,
10:05 and it’s usually easy to fit into your 
lifestyle. 1 big meal a day might also work,
10:10 but people tend to give up 
on that diet very quickly.
10:13 number 9: save your biggest meals for 
times when you tend to get the hungriest.
10:17 number 10: Many people find it easy to be in a 
calorie deficit when doing intermittent fasting.
10:23 It involves only giving yourself a 4 to 8 hour 
window to eat, and then not eating the rest of
10:28 the day. It might sound hard, but just know that 
when you don’t eat, you won’t just be constantly
10:32 hungry. Hunger comes and goes in waves. So If 
you just wait a little bit, the hunger goes away.
10:38 number 11: eat more protein, because 
protein makes you feel satisfied,
10:42 and you also burn about 20 calories 
just to digest 100 calories of protein.
10:48 number 12:
10:48 Speaking of protein, protein 
powder is good, but it’s processed,
10:53 and it’s a powder that you drink, so it’s not 
really as filling as other protein sources.
10:57 But if you need it to meet your protein 
requirements, then drink it with water.
11:01 number 13:
11:03 If you want to, try black 
coffee, or tea, since caffeine,
11:06 slightly boosts your metabolism, and 
slightly suppresses your appetite.
11:10 number 14:
11:11 - use smaller plates, smaller 
bowls, and smaller portion sizes,
11:15 because it tricks you into feeling full quickly.
11:18 number 15:
11:19 - if you mess up, don’t take it as an excuse 
to start eating tons of junk food.Because
11:23 even though messing up wasn’t part of the 
plan, giving up was never part of the plan.
11:28 Now onto exercise. it burns some 
calories, it improves your health,
11:32 and once you experience what it 
really takes to burn 200 calories,
11:35 you’re probably less likely to pop 
open a 200-calorie bag of chips.
11:39 So here are some tips:
11:41 number 1) lift weights. This will not only 
increase your metabolism, but it also burns
11:46 calories and helps you build muscle. You can 
use this website to get ideas for exercises.
11:51 number 2) go on more walks. 
Getting at least 10,000 steps
11:54 a day is basically a cheat code for 
burning extra calories and losing fat.
11:59 number 3) do more cardio. While diet is 
more important than exercise for losing fat,
12:04 cardio will make it easier. If you find it boring, 
you can try high intensity interval training,
12:10 or if you like, you can do circuit style 
workouts, which you can find lots of on youtube.
12:15 Some gym bros like to claim that 15-minute 
youtube workouts don’t work. But remember
12:20 that they watch hour-long videos 
of other people working out,
12:24 number 4) be less sedentary. not many people 
talk about this because it’s hard to explain.
12:29 But getting up and moving around and 
just doing stuff throughout the day,
12:33 burns way more calories than you would think.
12:35 This includes activities that you 
don't normally think of as exercise,
12:39 like taking the stairs, cleaning your 
house, pressure washing your driveway,
12:43 cooking, fidgeting, standing, 
walking around, carrying groceries,
12:48 and touching grass. Basically, anything 
except sitting or rotting in bed.
12:53 Lastly, a fat loss tip that everyone 
thinks doesn’t apply to them is to get
12:57 good quality sleep. Sleep regulates your 
hormones. And when it comes to fat loss,
13:01 these hormones pretty much determine everything.
13:04 Now you might be thinking, “well I don’t have to 
worry about that, **I already** get good sleep!!!”
