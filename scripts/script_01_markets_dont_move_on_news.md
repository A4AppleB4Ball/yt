# Script #01: "Markets Don't Move on News (They Already Moved)"

**Series:** Macro States
**Target Length:** 7-8 minutes
**Goal:** Establish core doctrine #1 - Markets are regimes, not reactions

## VISUAL & AUDIO PLAN

```
[SCREEN]: Chart/visual description
(VOICEOVER): What you say
{EDITING NOTE}: Pacing/emphasis notes
```

## THE SCRIPT

### [0:00-0:15] HOOK - THE PATTERN INTERRUPT

```
[SCREEN]: Nifty 50 chart, February 8, 2025 - dramatic 2% drop
(VOICEOVER):
On February 8th, the RBI surprised markets by holding rates steady.
And Nifty dropped 2% in minutes.

You think the RBI announcement moved the market.

It didn't.

{EDITING: Quick cuts, show multiple headlines claiming "RBI shock"}
```

---

### [0:15-0:45] THE REVEAL

```
[SCREEN]: Same chart, but zoom out 3 weeks earlier
(VOICEOVER):
Because if you zoom out just three weeks, you'll see the real story.

[SCREEN]: Highlight FII selling data, bond yields rising, VIX creeping up
(VOICEOVER):
Foreign institutional investors had been net sellers for 12 straight days.
The 10-year bond yield had already moved 40 basis points higher.
VIX was quietly climbing from 12 to 18.

The regime had already shifted.
The RBI announcement was just... the excuse retail needed to finally notice.

{EDITING: Each data point appears as mentioned}
```

---

### [1:00-1:30] EMPATHY & SETUP

```
[SCREEN]: Split screen - retail trader watchlist vs institutional flow data
(VOICEOVER):
I know what you're doing.

You've got your watchlist open at 9:14am.
You're watching CNBC.
You're in three telegram groups getting "levels" for BankNifty.

And you think you're doing research.

But here's the problem:
You're watching price.
They're watching flows.

And by the time price tells you the story...
The story already happened.

{EDITING: Show typical retail setup, then institutional Bloomberg terminal}
```

---

### [1:30-2:15] FRAMEWORK INTRO

```
[SCREEN]: Simple diagram - The Wrong Model vs The Right Model
(VOICEOVER):
This is how retail thinks markets work:
[SCREEN]: Linear flow: News → Reaction → Price Move

News happens. Market reacts. Price moves.
Simple. Logical. Wrong.

This is how markets actually work:
[SCREEN]: Circular flow: Liquidity → Flows → Positioning → Regime → Narrative → Retail

Liquidity conditions change.
Smart money repositions.
A regime shift happens quietly.
Then a narrative gets attached.
And retail finally shows up.

You're not early. You're the exit liquidity.

{EDITING: Animated diagrams, simple and clean}
```

---

### [2:15-4:30] THE DEEP DIVE - CONCRETE EXAMPLE

```
[SCREEN]: October 2024 chart setup
(VOICEOVER):
Let me show you a real example from October 2024.

[SCREEN]: News headline - "Nifty hits all-time high on strong earnings"
(VOICEOVER):
On October 15th, Nifty hit a new all-time high.
Every news outlet said the same thing:
"Strong corporate earnings drive markets higher."

Sounds right. Makes sense.

But let's look at what actually happened in the three weeks before.

[SCREEN]: Show three data layers appearing one by one

First: Global liquidity.
The Fed had just started cutting rates.
The dollar index dropped from 106 to 102.
That's $4 trillion in global liquidity suddenly looking for returns.

Second: FII flows.
Foreign institutions bought $2.8 billion in Indian equities in just 8 trading sessions.
Not because of earnings.
Earnings hadn't been announced yet.

Third: Market structure.
Open interest in Nifty calls exploded.
Put-call ratio dropped to 0.6.
Dealer positioning screamed "risk-on."

[SCREEN]: Overlay all three on the Nifty chart
(VOICEOVER):
All of this happened before the first earnings report.

The regime shifted from defensive to risk-on in late September.
The money moved in early October.
The price followed mid-October.
And the news? The news just gave retail a story to tell themselves.

[SCREEN]: Return to headline - "Strong earnings drive markets"
(VOICEOVER):
Strong earnings didn't drive the market.
The market drove itself into a risk-on regime...
And earnings were just the narrative that made it feel logical.

{EDITING: Layer the data carefully, this is the value payload}
```

---

### [4:30-5:30] WHY THIS MATTERS

```
[SCREEN]: Split examples - retail vs institutional timing
(VOICEOVER):
So why does this matter?

Because if you're waiting for news to make decisions,
you're always late.

When you see "RBI HOLDS RATES - MARKETS TUMBLE,"
institutional money already sold two weeks ago.

When you see "STRONG EARNINGS LIFT MARKETS,"
smart money already bought before the announcement.

You're not trading the event.
You're trading the aftermath.

And the aftermath is where retail gets trapped.

{EDITING: Show entry points - retail enters at tops, institutions entered earlier}
```

---

### [5:30-6:30] THE SOLUTION

```
[SCREEN]: Three simple inputs - regime detection framework
(VOICEOVER):
So what do you actually watch?

Three things. That's it.

One: Liquidity conditions.
Where are global yields? What's the dollar doing? Is liquidity expanding or contracting?

Two: Institutional flows.
What are FII and DII actually doing with their money? Not what they're saying. What they're doing.

Three: Market structure.
What does volatility look like? Where's positioning? What's the put-call ratio telling you?

[SCREEN]: Show simple dashboard layout
(VOICEOVER):
When all three align, the regime is clear.
When they diverge, the regime is shifting.

You don't need to predict.
You just need to observe.

And observation happens before the news.

{EDITING: Keep this section clean and practical, not overwhelming}
```

---

### [6:30-7:00] PREVIEW THE STACK

```
[SCREEN]: Quick glimpse of your actual system/dashboard
(VOICEOVER):
Now, checking all of this manually every day is tedious.

Which is why I built a system to do it.
It monitors liquidity. It tracks flows. It watches structure.
And it tells me when regimes shift.

That's what I'll show you in a future video.

But for now, just understand this:

{EDITING: Don't oversell, just preview}
```

---

### [7:00-7:20] THE CLOSING

```
[SCREEN]: Return to opening chart - RBI rate decision
(VOICEOVER):
Markets don't move on news.

They move on liquidity, flows, and positioning.

The news just tells you what already happened.

And if you're waiting for the news to trade...
You're not trading the market.

You're reacting to it.

{EDITING: Calm, matter-of-fact delivery}
```

---

### [7:20-7:30] SOFT CTA

```
[SCREEN]: Simple end card with channel name
(VOICEOVER):
That's it.

If this reframed how you see markets, subscribe.
